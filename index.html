			<h1>Who's this?</h1>
			<section>
			My main belief in life is to live without regret, so I want to live in every moment and live to the fullest. When people see me, they usually make comments as such, “Why are you so hyped today?” or “What’s the good news? You seem so energetic.” I am Yuchi, and yes, I am generally a loud, hyped one among a group. I am half a swimmer and half a foodie but a full junior in National Tsinghua University (NTHU), studying in the Department of Foreign Language and Literature (DFLL). Besides, I am also one of the co-captains in the swimming varsity and one of the TAs in a service-learning course in the residential college. Observing from the information shared above, you might consider me as an absolute extrovert; yet, the truth is—I am an extroverted introvert.

			I enjoy spending time alone on reading books, watching Netflix, cooking and baking but I also love organizing events and joining the events as well. In my department, I have plenty of chances reading and appreciate the time alone. Also, I am taking courses to learn both Deutsch and日本語 because I found learning a new language is inspiring and rewarding. The most exciting part is to actually speak the language to communicate with the native speakers. The service-learning course, international students buddy program, provides good a good opportunity for me to use the languages in my daily life. After taking the course for a year, I decided to take the job as a course organizer, aka TA, and now this is my second year as a TA in the program.

			<section>			Other than a student and a TA, I am a co-captain in the swimming team as well. I am responsible for the training routine and giving advice of training technique aspect. To perform good in this field, I also have to train on land, such as weight-lifting, strength-training, and moderate food consuming. To regulate the calories I take in, I cook as often as I can and sometimes bake whole food treats on my own so as to satisfy my sweet tooth and enjoy the moments of being with myself. Currently, I am in the stage of losing weight and am going to participate in <i>National Intercollegiate Athletic Games </i>taking place in late October.
