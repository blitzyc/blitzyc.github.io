			<h1>Who's this?</h1>
			<p>
			My main belief in life is to live without regret, so I live in every moment and eat to the fullest. I am Chuang Yuchi, and I am generally a loud, hyped one among a group. I am a junior in National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), majoring in Foreign Languages and Literature (DFLL). Besides, I am a co-captain in the swimming varsity and a TA in a service-learning course in the residential college but most importantly, I am a full-time foodie.

			I enjoy spending time alone reading, baking, cooking and watching Netflix, but I also love organizing events with people and joining the events as well. For me, language carries different aspects of a culture and shapes a person’s mind, so it’s inspiring and rewarding to learn about languages. Currently, I am taking courses to learn Deutsch and日本語, so if you have any interesting experience or opinions on this topic, you are more than welcome to share with me.

			In the swimming team, I am responsible for the training routine and giving advice on the training. To perform well in this field, training on land is important as well, such as weight-lifting, strength-training, and moderate food consuming. To regulate the calories I take in, I cook as often as I can and sometimes bake whole food treats so as to satisfy my sweet tooth even though I am on a diet. Apart from the diet part, I appreciate very much the life I have now.
