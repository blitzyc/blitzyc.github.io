			SUNQ RV founded in 1995. SUNQ RV have been dedicated to manufacturing camping vehicles and modifying car seats. We started from modifying SUVs into multifunction vehicles to satisfy the needs of our customers. As camping has become a hit in Taiwan, the founder of SUNQ RV, Ben Chuang, a man who loves traveling, integrated the techniques of our specialties, modifying SUV, with the innovative design of cars, recreational vehicle (RV). Our team has always been developing the better RV for our customers. Our RVs are designed for the conditions of Taiwan. </br>
			Recreational vehicles (RVs) can be referred to many different kinds of vehicle—campervans, motorhomes, caravans, and any vehicles used for the purpose of traveling and camping. Then the people who had never heard about the term, RV, might be confused by all these fancy words and curious about the differences among campervans, motorhomes and caravan. To put it simply, caravans refer to the vehicles that need to be towed by other cars, which means no engines in a caravan. For the lack of mobility, a caravan is also often called a fifth wheel. For campervans and motorhomes, both kinds of vehicles are capable of moving without the help of other motor vehicles. In other words, motorhomes and campervans are powered by internal combustion engines and it is self-propelled. Campervan is a subcategory under motorhomes but it specifically refers to the ones converted from a regular van and changed to be more applicable to sleeping inside. Here, in SUNQ RV, we provide the three kinds of RV mentioned above.

			露營車一詞可以用於多種不同的露營車，拖車、野營休旅車、自走式露營車或任何用於露營旅遊用途的車。看到這麼多種露營車，他們有什麼差別呢？簡單來說，露營拖車顧名思義即為需要被拖曳的車種，它沒有引擎無法自主移動。而野營休旅車及自走式露營車是指有內建引擎的露營車種，可以隨時隨地輕鬆地移動。野營休旅車屬於自走式露營車的一種，但專指那些從普通箱型車改造床鋪的露營車。升魁有提供以上這三種選擇可供您參考，若想了解更多資訊，請從選單點選其他分頁。</br>
