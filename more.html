			Since I am a student from FLL department, I would like to share the fasciation about language. It all started from the interesting scene I saw happened to my grandmother. My grandmother is an old lady that had never finished her elementary school. Her education level is high, not to mention her language ability. She does not speak Mandarin Chinese but only be capable of casting a few words, let alone her English proficiency. She basically does not understand English at all. However, once a Dutch lady visited my parents and we offered them dinner. My grandma came to talk to the lady and started to chat with her. They went to the garden and chatted about the plants she grows. They seemed to have a really good time out there. (Keep in mind that my grandma doesn’t speak English.) When I went out to see what they were talking, it is purely amazing what they were doing. They were talking entirely different things! My grandma introduced 絲瓜 to the Dutch lady was complimenting her on the garden saying that this is gorgeous. Do you see what happened there? It is the /g/ sound that links the conversation altogether. </br>
			From this experience, I understood that language is a means to communicate with people. Even when we are not capable of getting 100% proficiency of a language, it is always worthy of a try to speak it. In Taiwan, most students lack confidence to speak a foreign language when facing a stranger; however, language is should not be treated this way. How we learn a language actually harms the way we treat it. If more people could treat a foreign language as a communicative tool to connect, I believe the English proficiency level in Taiwan will improve a lot. Let’s hope that day will arrive soon.</br>
